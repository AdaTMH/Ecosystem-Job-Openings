# [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org) is Hiring #
  
## Senior Javascript Engineer ##

### About You

Are you a Javascript developer who likes new challenges?  Are you
excited about building tools for both developers and end users?  Are
you interested in Blockchain and its impact on society? If so, you
should consider working with Livepeer.

### About Livepeer

Livepeer's mission is to make video possible in the web3 stack. We are
building a decentralized video network that enables developers to
build video applications that are decentralized, cheaper, and more
reliable. Many video products can be built on top of Livepeer. For
example: decentralized social streaming platform (decentralized
Facebook Live or Twitch), pay-as-you-go video broadcast platform, or
uncensorable live journalism applications. Just like the Ethereum
network enables new types of decentralized applications, Livepeer
enables new types of video applications that were impossible before
due to the expensive nature of video infrastructure.

The Livepeer network also provides open and fair access for anyone to
participate in a crypto-economically secure protocol. Similar to
Bitcoin enabling anyone to become a miner and earn a block reward,
Livepeer enables anyone to become a transcoder and earn a fee by
processing video.

Livepeer is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer that is committed to inclusion and diversity. We are committed to provide a community and environment for mutual respect, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, national origin, age, physical and mental disability, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, military and veteran status, and any other characteristic protected by applicable law. We believe diversity and inclusion is crucial to our success and seek to recruit/develop from a diverse candidate pool.
