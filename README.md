# Ecosystem-Job-Openings
Please post your job openings here, include contact details. We will be happy to spread the word.

Ideally, post:
1. Position
2. Qualifications needed
3. Benefits
4. Contact e-mail 

Notes: we don't recommend people we don't know. Please connect with the teams yourself, talent needs to meet talent without middlemen.  

Obviously, this initiative was originated to help out the Consensys alumni but it's not restricted to them. We are all searching for a dream position.   

Please no recruiters.   

The Department of Decentralization does not get anything for referrals, nor does it want to, or benefits in any way. We are here to help.
