# IMPORTANT

The Department of Decentralization's Ecosystem Jobs repo is not responsible for the openings. Apply at your own discretion, and make sure to do your due diligence. Only recruiters and offers for outsourcing will be not merged.

Notes: we don't recommend people we don't know. Please connect with the teams yourself, talent needs to meet talent without middlemen.  

Obviously, this initiative was originated to help out the Consensys alumni but it's not restricted to them. We are all searching for a dream position.   

Please no recruiters.   

No outsourcing offers. We are trying to connect PEOPLE with JOBS. Not to grow your business portfolio. 

The Department of Decentralization does not get anything for referrals, nor does it want to, or benefits in any way. We are here to help.
