## About us

Commonwealth Crypto builds protocols to allow traders to maintain custody of their coins while trading at a cryptocurrency exchange. Our technology ensures that no one, even a compromised or hacked exchange, has the power to take custody of a traderâ€™s digital assets. Instead, traders can keep their coins securely housed in their wallet or custodial service, even as they trade. Our technology is compatible with top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and ZCash.

We are an early-stage Boston startup backed by top VCs in Boston, New York and Tokyo. By joining Commonwealth Crypto, you'll work on leading edge of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technology, bringing to market new ideas and products that were previously conceived only in a research lab. Our team is forging new paths in a rapidly-growing industry, by bringing a security-focused mindset to a space where a single misstep can lead to millions of dollars in lost funds.
