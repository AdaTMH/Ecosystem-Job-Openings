# CRUZEO iOS Developer

[CRUZEO](https://cruzeo.io) is the first truly decentralized ride sharing platform based on NEO and Ontology. We are looking for an enthusiastic developer with experience and knowledge in mobile apps for iOS and blockchain technologies.

We are a startup at the very beginning of the journey. Our team is very diverse with people in the US and UK. Our headquarter is in London. You would be working directly with the founders. The initial project is 3 months. 

Instead of sending a resume please take our [challenge](https://app.mooqita.org/app/solution?challenge_id=w4cKaMKTKWYffR2MR) and if you have it send us links to work samples of yours. We are looking for someone who can work independently and knows when to ask for help, has common sense, and great communication skills. 

This can be either an internship or contract work.
